This work of mine was done with the main aim to help people understand the factors that contribute or lead to a certain financial stage of a player or an organisation. 
Further into this report we will take a look at the scenario from the Individual and team point of view.

The raw data for this is a kaggle dataset, which was made from the data available on
liquipedia and the data was last updated in April, 2022 and I have only chosen the Top 20
in each category to make it easier for us to understand.

For every team and player, I will be comparing the Possible earnings,number of
tournaments won, and the region they belong to.
